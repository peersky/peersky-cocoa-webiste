# Peersky.eth?

Hi fellow internet surfer! Welcome to my small cozy space!

I am architecting reality for world to become a better place to the best of my abilities. I see this as search of balance between science, sustainable technology, life, love and wilderness where we must be very explicit in understanding that there exist only four materialistic needs any human has: **Fresh water, clean air, fertile soil and warm sun**

What does this imply to my practical work?

I attempt to zoom out, and maintain sense of purpose when selecting projects I work on;

I love brain breeze, cup of tea, mindfulness and meeting new exciting people. So, please, - get in touch!

## Im working on / interested at the moment

### Securing open economy

Crypto industry is a new emerging field which still is going trough turbulent times when people and projects get barrelled in the uncertainties. Yet it is a revolutionary technology that will change how networking is done.
This is a breakthrough of level importance comparable to generalized AI, quantum
supremacy and Fusion power.

In this context I find it's very important to work on secure architecture for the industry. Here is what Im doing:

- Securing some of biggest DeFi protocols such as Compound DAO @ OpenZeppelin
- Looking for ways to improve security of Ethereum ecosystem by orders of magnitude
- Educating end-users on how to use blockchain safely
- Researching on economics for P2P connection incentives for non-full nodes

### Designing next gen governance systems

The problems of BFT tolerance, effective decision making and helping great ideas and bright minds to be noticed and lifted is possible today with use of state-of-art technologies.

Today governance systems and projects are still based on principles of leadership that are defined in same ways as thousands years ago, while the technological advance in field of networking, communication, signing and privacy has stepped far beyond, thus we have to catch up in that field.
The result of applying new principles to this core problem will allow organizations to be faster, more effective and capable for more lasting impact as well as more useful and inclusive. In this context im doing:

- Working as Founder on experimental governance technology @ Rankify.it
- Participating in DAO builder working groups
- Exploring ways to tokenizing the lobbying and equilibrium
- Researching Zero-Knowledge proofs and MPC/HFE for privacy applications
- Exploring AI applications to field of governance

## Worked in the past / shelf with backlog

Before diving in to the blockchain web field most of my career I spend researching and building between two topics

### Radio and Electronics

This is essential industry that not only runs todays networks and communications, but also explains a lot about how our universe is structured and allows to look in to the depth of cosmos.

I always was fascinated by this and am lucky to hold Masters degree in the field, with academic interest mostly related to electromagnetism, wave equations and signal processing

In this field my work is concentrated around:

- Taking lead role to own product and define it's shape
- Building novel signal processing techniques for radio and audio domains.
- Architecting novel IoT mesh networking applications

### Conscious Community building

I believe building right community is a core for for our civilization success. I believe world should become a joyful place for everyone, and way to do that is trough changing yourself, educating people around you and helping friends to find their own, mindful way in life.

I cannot say more than [Constitution of Republic of Uzupis](https://uzhupisembassy.eu/uzhupis-constitution/) will tell you (you'll find most languages translation in that page). I believe world should just adapt it.

In this context I've

- Did core contribution towards creative community building
- Organized and produced various music and artistic events
- Contributed as visual decorator, musician and artist of many kinds
- Gave some of my fire to warm up those cold & lost in their life
