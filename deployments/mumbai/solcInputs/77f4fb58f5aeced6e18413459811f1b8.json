This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n * accounts that have been granted it.\n */\nabstract contract AccessControlUpgradeable is Initializable, ContextUpgradeable, IAccessControlUpgradeable, ERC165Upgradeable {\n    function __AccessControl_init() internal onlyInitializing {\n    }\n\n    function __AccessControl_init_unchained() internal onlyInitializing {\n    }\n    struct RoleData {\n        mapping(address => bool) members;\n        bytes32 adminRole;\n    }\n\n    mapping(bytes32 => RoleData) private _roles;\n\n    bytes32 public constant DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE = 0x00;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Modifier that checks that an account has a specific role.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

Compucationaly inefficient.\n                - 2: implement onERC721Received such that there is NFT vault in the contract, later fill funding position from that vault.\n                    That way applicant could pre-send NFT's to the contract and callfing fund later would pull those out from the vault.\n\n    */\n    //    function fulfillERC721Ids() private\n    //    {\n\n    //    }\n    function fulfillERC72Balance(\n        address erc721addr,\n        // uint256 id,\n        ContractCondition storage tokenReq,\n        address from // address payee, // address beneficiary, // address burnAddress, // address lockAddress\n    ) private view {\n        ERC721 token = ERC721(erc721addr);\n\n        require(\n            tokenReq.lock.amount == 0 &&\n                tokenReq.burn.amount == 0 &&\n                tokenReq.pay.amount == 0 &&\n                tokenReq.bet.amount == 0,\n            \"ERC721 transfers not supported\"\n        );\n        if (tokenReq.have.amount != 0 && from != address(this)) {\n            uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(from);\n            require(balance >= tokenReq.have.amount, \"Not enough ERC721 balance\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    function fulfillERC1155(\n        address erc1155addr,\n        uint256 id,\n        ContractCondition storage tokenReq,\n        address from,\n        address payee,\n        address beneficiary,\n        address burnAddress,\n        address lockAddress\n    ) private {\n        ERC1155Burnable token = ERC1155Burnable(erc1155addr);\n        uint256 value = tokenReq.have.amount;\n        if (value != 0) {\n            uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(from, id);\n            require(balance >= value, \"ERC1155 balance is not valid\");\n        }\n        value = tokenReq.pay.amount;\n        if (value != 0) {\n            // token.transfe\n            token.safeTransferFrom(from, payee, id, value, tokenReq.pay.data);\n        }\n        value = tokenReq.bet.amount;\n        if (value != 0) {\n            token.safeTransferFrom(from, beneficiary, id, value, tokenReq.bet.data);\n        }\n        value = tokenReq.burn.amount;\n        if (value != 0) {\n            if (burnAddress == address(0)) {\n                token.burn(from, id, value);\n            } else {\n                token.safeTransferFrom(from, burnAddress, id, value, tokenReq.burn.data);\n            }\n        }\n        value = tokenReq.lock.amount;\n        if (value != 0) {\n            token.safeTransferFrom(from, lockAddress, id, value, tokenReq.lock.data);\n        }\n    }\n\n    function fulfill(\n        Condition storage position,\n        address from,\n        address payee,\n        address beneficiary,\n        address burnAddress,\n        address lockAddress\n    ) private {\n        if (from == address(this)) {\n            if (position.ethValues.lock != 0) {\n                payable(lockAddress).transfer(position.ethValues.lock);\n            }\n            if (position.ethValues.pay != 0) {\n                payable(payee).transfer(position.ethValues.pay);\n            }\n            if (position.ethValues.bet != 0) {\n                payable(beneficiary).transfer(position.ethValues.bet);\n            }\n            if (position.ethValues.burn != 0) {\n                payable(burnAddress).transfer(position.ethValues.burn);\n            }\n        } else {\n            uint256 VLReq = position.ethValues.lock +\n                position.ethValues.pay +\n                position.ethValues.bet +\n                position.ethValues.burn;\n            require(msg.value >= VLReq, \"msg.value too low\");\n        }\n        for (uint256 i = 0;
